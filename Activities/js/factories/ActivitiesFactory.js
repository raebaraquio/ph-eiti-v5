While the EITI process is not expected to provide solutions to all issues related to the extractives, it can provide a platform for discussion of such issues. Local governments can take advantage of the transparency measures used by EITI in local budget processes and revenue management as it provides a mechanism for tracking payments of companies and shares of LGUs from national wealth. It can also educate local leaders to appreciate the complexities of extractive operations and finance, and how mandated social expenditures can be used to complement local development plans. Moreover, the EITI process has proved to be useful in other countries in easing tension at the local level as it calls for a sustained dialogue among key stakeholders.</p><p>The two-day LGU Roadshow was held in five key cities across the country. The first day focused on discussing current issues in the extractive sector, policy recommendations and how the EITI process can contribute to good governance in the extractive industries. Members from the national multi stakeholder group (MSG) sat as panelists during an open forum. This provided a platform for discussion of issues in the extractive sector such as management of environmental funds, distribution of shares from national wealth, long-term planning for local development harnessing LGU shares, SDMP funds and other social expenditures. The second day served as half-day workshop for EITI reporting process.</p><p><strong>Here is a summary of the total participants from the roadshows:</strong></p><table class=\"activitiesSection-table frequencyTable\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"3\"><thead><tr><th>Clusters</th><th>Number of Provinces</th><th>Number of Municipalities/Cities</th><th>Number of Participants</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BUTUAN</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>PALAWAN</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>CEBU</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>DAVAO</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>LUZONWIDE</td><td>5</td><td>11</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>23</td><td>37</td><td>387</td></tr></tbody></table>"

The graphic artists were tasked to transform complex EITI data into stories and created accompanying visualizations that can be used to increase public awareness on EITI and the extractive industry.</p><p>Representatives from national secretariats and Multi-Stakeholder Groups (MSGs) from the region served as mentors whom the graphic designers can consult on the usability of their graphics, and to provide explanation on their countries' EITI data.</p>"

The Conference was attended by around two hundred participants from government, the industry and civil society.</p> <p>Participants from the government were comprised of representatives from the Department of Finance, Commission on Audit, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources and the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, the Philippine Ports Authority, the Department of Energy, the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, the Bureau of Local Government Finance, the Bureau of Treasury, National Economic Development Authority, Board of Investments, and select representatives from local government, the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department, the Senate Economic Planning Office and the Senate Tax Study Research Office. From the industry, mining and oil and gas companies were represented by the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines and the Petroleum Association of the Philippines, respectively. Members of the Bantay Kita coalition of CSOs were also in attendance. </p><p>Also present were representatives from PH-EITI's development partners including Mr. Trevor Lewis, Deputy Ambassador of the British Embassy-Manila; Ms. Catherine Rees, First Secretary for Economic and Trade Policy from the Australian Embassy; and Ms. Narcisa Rivera, Senior Program Officer of the Canadian Embassy. </p><p>The Conference was an opportunity for the PH-EITI MSG to present the milestones it has achieved for the past year, particularly the signing of Executive Order 79, formally declaring the country\'s commitment to participate in the EITI and Executive Order 147 or the \"Creation of the Philippine Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative\" which duly instituted the PH-EITI and the PH-EITI Multi-stakeholder Group, in accordance with the EITI international guidelines. The MSG\'s activities for the past year were also highlighted, particularly on capacity building which included the training on the reporting template, the bilateral meeting with the EITI International Secretariat and the World Bank, the conference on the EITI Standard, participation of the MSG in the Regional EITI Conference and staff development training for the PH-EITI Secretariat. Learning sessions and various stakeholder engagement and confidencebuilding activities were also mentioned, particularly the forum on EITI with the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives and local government units including regular MSG and TWG meetings. The Conference was also an opportunity to present the different reporting mining, oil and gas companies that have signed the BIR waiver. It was also reported that the MSG was able to engage an Independent Administrator for the Philippines – PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PWC). </p><p>The National Conference likewise enabled the different stakeholders to outline their next steps in EITI implementation by re-evaluating their commitment and deciding on concrete ways forward. Mr. Wouter Biesterbos from the EITI International Secretariat and Timor Leste\'s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources, H.E. Alfredo Pires presented current trends in global EITI implementation. Other presenters included Assistant Secretary Ma. Teresa S. Habitan of the Department of Finance and PH-EITI Focal Person and former National Coordinator and Presidential Advisor on Climate Change Secretary Elisea \"Bebet\" Gozun. Assistant Secretary Habitan presented the PH-EITI Annual Activity Report while Secretary Gozun discussed the challenges in extractive industries governance. </p><p>Governor Alfonso V. Umali, President of the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines (ULAP) in his message in behalf of the Local Government Units said, \"EITI has very noble objectives. This is the reason why local government units and ULAP continue to support the initiative. We believe in what it has to offer. The extractive industry has to offer. The extractive industry has a history of distrust and conflict. To this day, it continues to struggle with that. We, representatives of local government units, see the EITI as a leap forward towards addressing at least some of the issues surrounding the mining, oil, and gas industries.\" </p><p>Other topics discussed included the Open Government Initiative and Open Data Philippines presented by Undersecretary Richard Bon Moya of the Department of Budget and Management and Mr. Gabriel Baleos of the Open Data Task Force, respectively. </p><p>In his welcome remarks, Undersecretary Moya stated, \"Open Government Partnership converges with the movement for greater openness. Aside from disclosure, we have to check whether we are getting the job done. Transparency is about building of trust and accountability. Making extractive industries work for the country and the people\'s interest. EITI seeks to deeply embed transparency in government systems.\"</p><p>The Conference ended with a presentation on the scope of the EITI report delivered by National Coordinator Atty. Marie Gay Alessandra Ordenes and the presentation of the proposed reporting template by PWC.</p><p>Secretary Cesar V. Purisima, summarized the two-day Conference best in his message as the Senior Lead Government Official of EITI. According to the Secretary, \"EITI is more than just reporting. It is important that we reconcile our talk with our walk. The change in how we do things must be the objective. In the way we work together and the way we make mining a mutually beneficial endeavor. </p><p>It has been a year since our candidacy has been approved. By the time we end the Aquino administration, we hope to institutionalize this partnership and we give meat to the spirit of EITI and we get full participation in the industry and identify how much we ought to collect and how much we collected.</p><p>If it does work, then the Philippines has a good chance of going back to its rightful place in the community of East Asia nations.\"</p>"

This was the statement made by Undersecretary Jeremias N. Paul of the Department of Finance in his opening remarks during the Conference on the Adoption of the 2013 EITI standards held at Crowne Plaza, Manila, on September 26 and 27, 2013. The event was conducted by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Secretariat and the World Bank, with technical support from the Revenue Watch Institute, and was participated in by representatives from the government, civil society organizations and the mining, oil and gas sectors. The objective of the event was to increase the stakeholders’ understanding of the 2013 EITI Standard for reporting; help stakeholders define objectives for EITI Philippines; and define ambitions of the report in relation to the implications of the new requirements as they relate to the context of the extractive industry in the Philippines.</p><p class=\"paragraph-content\">The conference stimulated lively and constructive dialogue and debates among all stakeholders which produced a shared set of provisional objectives for the first Philippines EITI Report to date. These include: show the direct and indirect contribution of the extractive sector to the economy; strengthen public oversight of natural resource management; strengthen natural resource management; build trust and reduce conflict among stakeholders; and help improve the business environment in the sector. The dialogue on these provisional objectives will continue and be refined as government, industry, and civil society representatives review the Philippines EITI work plan and produce the first report next year.</p><p class=\"paragraph-content\">At the end of the two days stakeholders concluded that the process made them realize that they have common objectives for promoting transparency and accountability in the extractive sector. Professor Tess Tabada, a representative from the civil society remarked that the government’s decision to sign on to the initiative has given rise to a special time in our history that will create an environment to empower communities to have access to reliable information Mr. Gerard H. Brimo, President and CEO, Nickel Asia Corporation pointed to the opportunity the initiative presents in opening a space for industry and civil society groups to meet and have constructive dialogue and reach common understanding on issues related to transparency and accountability in promoting responsible mining in the Philippines.</p><p class=\"paragraph-content\">EITI is an international standard that ensures transparency around countries oil, gas and mineral resources. It is developed and overseen by a multi-stakeholder process involving government, civil society and industry representatives. This process is governed by rules set by the EITI Board in Oslo Norway and supported by the World Bank through technical and financial assistance to implementing countries. Changes to the rules that govern the initiative this year came with the approval of the 2013 EITI Standard which expanded the scope of reporting requirements for candidate countries. The Philippines became an Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate country in May 2013.</p>"
